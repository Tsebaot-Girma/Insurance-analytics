Insurance Analytics Project
Overview
The Insurance Analytics project focuses on processing and analyzing insurance policy data to derive valuable insights. This project involves handling missing data, cleaning the dataset, and preparing it for further exploration or modeling tasks. The dataset includes various features related to insurance policies, customers, vehicles, and claims.

Features
The dataset contains the following key columns:

Customer Information

Bank, AccountType, MaritalStatus, Gender, Citizenship, etc.
Vehicle Details

VehicleIntroDate, VehicleType, make, Model, Cylinders, etc.
Insurance Policy Information

PolicyID, UnderwrittenCoverID, TransactionMonth, IsVATRegistered, etc.
Claims and Coverage

TotalPremium, TotalClaims, CoverType, CoverCategory, etc.
Flags and Indicators

NewVehicle, CrossBorder, WrittenOff, Rebuilt, Converted, etc.
Objectives
Handle Missing Values:

Impute missing values in categorical and numerical columns.
Create flags for columns with missing data where necessary.
Drop columns that are entirely missing or irrelevant.
Data Transformation:

Ensure consistent data types (e.g., convert VehicleIntroDate to a datetime format).
Handle categorical data using mode imputation.
Prepare the dataset for downstream analysis.
Build a Clean Dataset:

Produce a dataset free of missing values and ready for analytics or machine learning models.
File Structure
data/: Contains raw and processed datasets.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, cleaning, and analysis.
src/: Python scripts for handling missing data and performing data transformations.
readme.md: Project overview and usage instructions (this file).
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Tsebaot-Girma/Insurance-analytics.git
cd Insurance-analytics
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Cleaning: Run the data_cleaning.py script in the script/ folder to process the raw data:

bash
Copy code
python script/data_cleaning.py
Exploration: Use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ folder for exploring and visualizing the data:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb
Analytics: Build analytics models or visualizations using the clean dataset in the data/processed/ folder.

Key Steps for Data Cleaning
Identify columns with missing values and handle them based on their type:

Categorical columns: Impute using the mode.
Numerical columns: Impute using the median.
Datetime columns: Impute using the most frequent date.
Irrelevant columns: Drop columns with no useful data.
Create flags for missing values in key columns to retain information on missingness.

Save the cleaned dataset for downstream analysis.

Future Work
Implement advanced imputation techniques (e.g., KNN or MICE) for better accuracy.
Explore feature engineering to create derived variables.
Build predictive models for claims forecasting or customer segmentation.
